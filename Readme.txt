This is the second project of my first year studying programming
So the main idea of the project is that when we calculating two very big integers together, the problem is usual type of variable is not be able to
hold the value of that number, for example long long is only available for 16 bytes
So i have thinked about another alternative data structure to hold the value of these bigNums and then use some natural algorithm to proceed the calculation

The main DS i use in this is a Linked List (well to be honest i think String is much better for manipulating but string is a consecutive char array while linked list is full only when ur ram is full)
